    <p id="par1">Opossums prefer woody habitats, particularly deciduous forests that seasonally shed their leaves. They are also commonly found close to a water source, such as a stream or lake. Opossums are, however, highly adaptable. They have become quite adept at surviving in urban areas.<sup id="siteref1"><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p id="par2">Opossums are found in North, Central, and South America. The Virginia opossum lives in regions as far north as Canada and as far south as Central America, while other types of opossums only inhabit countries south of the United States. The Virginia opossum can often be found in wooded areas, though its habitat may vary widely. Opossums are generally found in areas like forest, shrubland, mangrove, rainforest, eucalyptus forest etc. Opossums have been found moving towards north in recent years. <sup id="siteref2"><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>
